At Transpaer, we analyze data from top products and company certifying organisations and show transparent data to users, in order to help them make better consumer decisions.

As a producer this is how YOU can help us to process the data to make sure your products are displayed correctly:
 - make sure your company has entry on Wikidata with precise details such as descriptions, websites, IDs (e.g. VAT number, GTIN, EAN) 
 - make sure you or your products have several certifications

Are we missing any certifications of your products in our data? Let us know!
